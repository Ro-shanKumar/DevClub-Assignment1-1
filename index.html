					<p class="faqhead">HOW DOES COVID-19 COMPARE TO OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS?</p>
					<p>This depends very much on where people live and how old they are, with some parts of the world hit harder than others, and some age groups being affected more, such as older people. However, even in countries where the COVID-19 death rate
						seems relatively low, the indirect impact on reduced health services, vaccine supply shortages, and reluctance to seek medical treatment for fear of infection is having a drastic impact and putting tens of millions of people at risk
						– including children and newborns.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="int">
					<p class="faqhead">HOW EFFECTIVE ARE MASKS AND DO THEY ALSO NEED TO COVER MY NOSE?</p>
					<p>Masks alone are not enough to fully protect someone from the virus, but they still have an essential role to play in protecting high risk individuals, such as frontline health care workers. For most people the greatest benefit lies not
						in protecting the wearer, but those around them. When combined with other safety measures like physical distancing and practicing good hygiene, they are a very effective tool with little to no disruption to normal life.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="int">
					<p class="faqhead">WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE HERD IMMUNITY WITHOUT VACCINES?</p>
					<p>Attempting to achieve natural herd immunity through infection will lead to a rise in cases, and a surge in the number of deaths. Moreover, natural immunity to coronaviruses usually only lasts for up to a couple of years. As Kristian Andersen,
						an immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute in California warned, this approach could “lead to unacceptable and unnecessary untold human death and suffering.”</p>
